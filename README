INTRODUCTION:
The Generic Hash Table (GHT) is a hash table that should be
extensible, generic and clean (codewise). You can store any kind of
data with it and, specify hash functions (or write your own) and
specify heuristics to use (like transposing touched elements).

The hash table *should* be portable, but it has only been tested on
Windows (x86) Linux (x86) and Solaris (SPARC). It compiles with the
-ansi directive under GCC, so it should hopefully be possible to
compile under many other systems as well.

USAGE
To use the library, add
  #include <ght_hash_table.h>

to your source-file and link your executable with
  -lghthash

An example would be:
  $ gcc -o hash_test -lghthash hash_test.c

to compile the hash_test program (after you've installed the library).

Compilers and linkers other than GCC might work differently, but the
principle should be the same.

DOCUMENTATION:
Look in the html/ subdirectory for doxygen-generated
documentation.

There are a few examples:

- examples/simple.c -  a very basic example of the hash table use.
- examples/hash_test.c - a more elaborate example.
- examples/dict_example.c - a more "real" example. Reads a text-file,
                   stores the words in a table and looks up the words
                   of another file.
- examples/interactive.c - lets you try the API interactively
